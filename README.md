I generated over $15M in profits for my clients in less than 3 years, thanks to the correct interpretation of the market and the good analysis of the data generated. I’m so passionate about tech that I run a TikTok/YouTube channel where my son and I teach kids about IT, I'm dedicating significant study hours towards becoming the best pentester and then a CTO. My technical expertise spans networks, PC maintenance, data analysis, and project management. Passionate about cybersecurity and businesses, I aim to merge my diverse skills to make a meaningful impact while inspiring the next generation in tech. I also own a digital transformation company for the medical industry.
